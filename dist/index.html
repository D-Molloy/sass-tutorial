    <h1>SCSS!</h1>
    <p class="main__paragraph1">
      If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see. Trees grow however makes them happy.
      For the lack of a better word I call them hangy downs. This is an example of what you can do with just a few
      things, a little imagination and a happy dream in your heart. And maybe, maybe, maybe... Water's like me. It's
      laaazy ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things.
      Van Dyke Brown is a very nice brown, it's almost like a chocolate brown. There we are. Anything you want to do you
      can do here. Just let your mind wander and enjoy. This should make you happy. Pretend you're water. Just floating
      without any effort. Having a good day.
